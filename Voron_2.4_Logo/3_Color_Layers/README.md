# Why and How I redesigned this Project:

After trying to use my Cricut Maker 3 to complete this project, I discovered that the Cricut Design Space Software can not
handle this large of a project.  There are a huge amount of cuts in the vinyl.

To solve the hudge delay that Cricut Design Space Software takes to process this project, I choose to split this project up into smaller or "sub-projects".

### Understanding the organization of this repository:

1. OLD files folder contains the project as one hudge project.
2. Current Design Files folder contains the project as I have currently designed it.

### Understanding the organization of the "Current Design Files": Folder:

This folder contains the following sub-folders:

1.  Gold Path
2.  Layout
3.  Red Path

The way I approached the project was to combine the Silhouette path, the Grey Path and what I call the Blue Path.  When these three paths are
put together I call them the "Layout".  I created another vector path that is the negative space between the Voron Design Parts that make
up the Voron Logo.  This "negative space" path is called the "Blue" Path.  It will allow you to cut each part out as a seperate items or 
combined the seperate items onto one sheet as you see fit.  The Blue path should be cut from "REMOVABLE" Vinyl so that it can be removed after you place all
the parts into their corresponding locations.

So cut the Layout first ("Combined_Layout_Cricut_Voron2.4Logo_BackPanel_3Layers_900ppi [Converted].svg").  Then use seperate projects for the Gold Path parts and Red Path parts.

I supply a .jpg files for both Gold Path Parts and the Red Path Parts that show you where each part location belongs.  Within the Gold Path folder
you will find a folder called an "SVG" folder.  This "SVG" folder contains each individual file in a unique .svg file so that you can arrange
all the parts for the corresponding path (red or gold) in any way you want on you sheets of vinyl so that you reduce the wasted material.

Under each "SVG" sub-folder the individual parts for that path are listed as "Asset 1.svg". So each part has a number assigned to it.
The following two .jpg files show where each part number is located in the larger design.

The layout for Red Path Parts:

The layout for Gold Path Parts:

If you choose not to layout the Red parts and/or Gold parts yourself, I have supplied .svg files to make your job easier:
1. For the Red Path Parts - I broke them up into 5 sepearte .svg files (68 parts in 5 files instead of 68 seperate .svg files located in "SVG" sub-folder)
2. For the Gold Path Parts - I have 1 .svg file (22 parts in 1 file instead of 22 seperate .svg files located in "SVG" sub-folder)

Again, cut the Layout layer first ("Combined_Layout_Cricut_Voron2.4Logo_BackPanel_3Layers_900ppi [Converted].svg").  Then procede with
starting separate projects for cutting the Red Path Parts and the Gold Path Parts.
